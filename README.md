# My Resume

This is a repository of my resume I created using HTML and CSS

It has four sections: About Me, My Education and Experience, Skills and Abilities, and Contact me.
I used `flexbox` layout as much as I can to make my webpage responsive.

## About Me
This section is about me as a person. The picture on the left for my first commit is **NOT** me. I did not have a professional image taken therefore I just used a stock image as a placeholder for now.

## My Resume
This section is about my education and my work experience. 

## Skills and Abilities
I have not added anything in my first commit as I am still editing this information.

## Contact Me
In this section I have included my address, my email and my phone number.

## Webpage on Github Pages
https://winghang97.github.io/Resume/ **Please note that the image of the girl is _NOT_ me**

# Future edits
- Take a professional photo and replace the stock image
